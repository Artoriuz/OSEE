# Open-Source Electrical Engineering Curriculum
This repository contains online courses and textbook recommendations that together cover most of the basic Electrical Engineering knowledge.

The "curriculum" is based on my personal experience, but revised to fit into 3 years due to the strong inspiration I got from [ETH Zürich's](https://ee.ethz.ch/studies/bachelor.html) and [MIT's](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/docs/ug/freshman_roadmaps.pdf) curriculums.

## Structure
The curriculum is split into 2 parts, a mandatory core and several electives. The core aims to cover the basic knowledge every electrical engineer should know (even if you're not a specialist), opening the doors to the more specific knowledge. Some universities allow you to choose a specialisation, focusing on a single part of EE, which is exactly how the 5th and 6th semesters are designed here.

## Core
The core is divided into 4 knowledge areas:
- **Mathematics**: Calculus, Linear Algebra, Statistics, etc.
- **Electricity**: Electromagnetic Theory, Electric Circuits, Electronics, etc.
- **Computing**: Boolean Algebra, Logic Circuits, Programming, etc.
- **Signals**: Signals and Systems, Control Systems, Communications Systems, Digital Signal Processing, etc.

The "Mathematics" subjects are the very first pillars engineers needs to build in order to sustain the rest of our knowledge, you'll need calculus to understand electricity, linear algebra to understand robotics, statistics to understand communications, etc.

The "Electricity" subjects are related to the physical aspects of electromagnetic waves and electronics, which are used in clever ways to build everything else in EE.

The "Computing" subjects cover the logical parts of digital electronics, an area of knowledge that ended up giving birth to IT, CS, CE, etc.

Finally, the "Signals" subjects cover what might be the most unique knowledge in EE, being able to understand what the frequency domain is and how we can design things outside the time-domain. Signals and Systems will lead the way to all knowledge related to control systems, communications systems, computer vision, etc.

## 1st Semester

**Introduction to Electrical Engineering**

I strongly recommend checking YouTube videos about electronics, hardware, software, etc. See if they interest you. Recommending a textbook is extremely difficult since what you want is an overview of what EE is all about,
but that doesn't mean cool casual books don't exist. Brian Kernighan, the author of the quintessential C language book, wrote something very interesting aimed at people who don't work in the technology field but who'd
still want to understand the basics of computing and the digital world. It was never meant to be read by engineering students, but it can be a good introduction since it gives you a showcase of many concepts without delving
too deep into technical details.
